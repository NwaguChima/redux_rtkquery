This BLOG project, basically built to show advanced REDUX toolkit and react setup, Optimizations for performance, and RTK Query.

## Available Scripts

A basic blog that can perform CRUD operations. Redux toolkit is used for state management.
Async Thunk was used to handle asynchronous actions and json placeholder endpoint is used for fetching data with axios.
CreateEntityAdapater is used to optimize performance and query performance, giving a better state structure, while also avoiding uneccesary rerenders.
Implemented normalized cached state with RTK Query, and Optimistic update which is usually undone when the network request fails.
